## **Description**
The URL Shortener Microservice is a project developed as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and backend development. This application creates short URLs for users and redirects them to the original URLs when accessed. It is functionally similar to [this reference](https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks).
